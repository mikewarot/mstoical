.SH DESCRIPTION

I'm not the first man to have her, and I certainly won't be the last.
She is not soft. She is not perfect. And though all her apparent beauty may be
a mere product of my imagination, she's mine for the moment and I will make a
mark on her; One so deep, so colorful and passionate, that she will carry it
forever with regret. A bondage to guilt, for all the pain that she has caused
others.
